# day11
As I mentioned in day10, I am going to re-build the website for the Chinese Student Association in University of Florida, since the UFL has its own design rule for website, I have to design a front-end model myself to make the CSA website looks like the UFL site, I am not copying the code from UF, I just re-design it.

So, the day11 is for the typography of the website, the UFL new style guide is using "Gentona and Quadon" as the two main types of font, so I download the font from their official website and upload the font to the web so that the new font could be rendered even when the user did not install that font on their computer.

The basic format is this:

@font-face {
font-family: 'font-family-name';
src: url('../fonts/source-file');
}

Re-build a site is not a one-day-project, and I am busy of looking for full-time jobs, I really want to spend a whole bunch of time to finish this for once, but...
Any way, tomorrow for day12 would be the "Page components re-design".
